# ptoribi: Lightning will only add to the containers the capabilities uncommented in this file (one line per capability, please do not leave white lines)
# the following information about capabilities was taken from the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities
#ALL				# Give all possible capabilities
#SETPCAP			# Modify process capabilities.
MKNOD				# Create special files using mknod(2).
AUDIT_WRITE			# Write records to kernel auditing log.
CHOWN				# Make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs (see chown(2)).
NET_RAW				# Use RAW and PACKET sockets.
DAC_OVERRIDE		# Bypass file read, write, and execute permission checks.
FOWNER				# Bypass permission checks on operations that normally require the file system UID of the process to match the UID of the file.
#FSETID				# Don’t clear set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits when a file is modified.
KILL				# Bypass permission checks for sending signals.
SETGID				# Make arbitrary manipulations of process GIDs and supplementary GID list.
SETUID				# Make arbitrary manipulations of process UIDs.
NET_BIND_SERVICE	# Bind a socket to internet domain privileged ports (port numbers less than 1024).
#SYS_CHROOT			# Use chroot(2), change root directory.
#SETFCAP			# Set file capabilities.
#SYS_MODULE			# Load and unload kernel modules.
SYS_RAWIO			# Perform I/O port operations (iopl(2) and ioperm(2)).
SYS_PACCT			# Use acct(2), switch process accounting on or off.
SYS_ADMIN			# Perform a range of system administration operations.
#SYS_NICE			# Raise process nice value (nice(2), setpriority(2)) and change the nice value for arbitrary processes.
#SYS_RESOURCE		# Override resource Limits.
#SYS_TIME			# Set system clock (settimeofday(2), stime(2), adjtimex(2)); set real-time (hardware) clock.
SYS_TTY_CONFIG		# Use vhangup(2); employ various privileged ioctl(2) operations on virtual terminals.
#AUDIT_CONTROL		# Enable and disable kernel auditing; change auditing filter rules; retrieve auditing status and filtering rules.
#MAC_ADMIN			# Allow MAC configuration or state changes. Implemented for the Smack LSM.
#MAC_OVERRIDE		# Override Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Implemented for the Smack Linux Security Module (LSM).
NET_ADMIN			# Perform various network-related operations.
#SYSLOG				# Perform privileged syslog(2) operations.
DAC_READ_SEARCH		# Bypass file read permission checks and directory read and execute permission checks.
#LINUX_IMMUTABLE	# Set the FS_APPEND_FL and FS_IMMUTABLE_FL i-node flags.
NET_BROADCAST		# Make socket broadcasts, and listen to multicasts.
IPC_LOCK			# Lock memory (mlock(2), mlockall(2), mmap(2), shmctl(2)).
IPC_OWNER			# Bypass permission checks for operations on System V IPC objects.
SYS_PTRACE			# Trace arbitrary processes using ptrace(2).
#SYS_BOOT			# Use reboot(2) and kexec_load(2), reboot and load a new kernel for later execution.
LEASE				# Establish leases on arbitrary files (see fcntl(2)).
#WAKE_ALARM			# Trigger something that will wake up the system.
#BLOCK_SUSPEND		# Employ features that can block system suspend.
